# Day 1

Well, December 1st caught be by surprise! I wasn't ready for AoC.

But day 1 is done. Right from the start we have an example of not trying to second guess part 2 from part 1. Keep the part 1 na√Øve, and solve part 2 when you get there.

Beyond that, there were no gotchas, and no specialist algorithm knowledge was required.
