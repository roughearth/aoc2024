# Day 4

Not too challenging, but needed grid functions don't have utilities for. Part 1 takes ~30ms. I mean, that's _OK_, but I wonder if there's a well known algorithm I should be using.

Looked at the global leaderboard today. The #1 for part one did it in 19 seconds. The rules say don't use AI!!!!!
