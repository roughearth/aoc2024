# Day 2

I told you I wasn't ready! That took longer than it should have.

* I initially missed the fact that values could be decreasing as well as increasing.
* I then got a little hung up on the `O()` of part 2 without even just trying the na√Øve solution first.
* I also forgot that, in the case where the first value is the one that's ignored, that might change the expected direction of change.

Got there in the end though.
