# Day 3

Ah Regex! `mul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)`. My first attempt was "no code", just see how many times VSCode found that regex. 726 - too low! Ah but RTFQ, it's not just count them but do them...

Then, for the first time ever, the input doesn't fit in a JS template string. Because I couldn't be bothered to enhance my framework with async file reading, I fudged in the console to get a JS compliant string expression.
