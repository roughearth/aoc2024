# Day 15

Today took a awhile. Probably longer than it should have.

I could probably adapt the `canMove` and `moveRobot` functions from my part 2 solution to work for part 1, but I'm not going to bother.

There's probably a well known gaming algorithm that would have made this easier, but I don't know it.
