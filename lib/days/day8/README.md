# Day 8

* Uh, oh - the puzzle input is small.
* Question is worded to make you think to check the antennae match a letter or number, but you don't, because they all do.
* Apparently no need to check for nodes between the antennae! Good job I checked that answer first.
* Actually small input was no problem. I was worried about a `O()` explosion in part 2, but it was fine. Maybe because I drove it from the antennae not the grid?
