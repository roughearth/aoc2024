# Day 9

Today is the first time this year that my algorithm gave the right answer for the example, but not the real input. On part 2, I'd forgotten the requirement that the file must move left.

Another unusual thing is that the data structure that the input gets parsed in to is different for each part. I try to avoid second guessing what part 2 might be, but usually end up using the same data structure. In this cas the structure I used for part 1 was not suitable for part 2, but was still better for part 1, even once I knew what part 2 was.
