# Day 19

Not bad. Looked like simple recursion, but it turned out it needed caching to run in reasonable time. Caching turned something that I gave up on after a minute into something that ran in a few milliseconds.

I could have repurposed the part 2 counter in part 1, but that would have meant mor typing!
